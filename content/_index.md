# Ashley Grealish

Hi, I'm Ashley, co-founder and CEO of [Windfall Energy](https://www.windfallenergy.com). While the clean energy transition is accelerating, I noticed that most solutions exclude the millions living in flats and rented homes. That's why I'm building Windfall - to create affordable, installation-free home batteries that work for everyone.

My journey in clean energy began while studying Engineering at @[imperialcollege](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked with @[e.quinox](https://web.archive.org/web/20130429044437/http://www.e.quinox.org/index.php/our-solutions/standalone) to bring renewable energy to rural communities in East Africa.

This led me to scale solar solutions across sub-Saharan Africa @[bboxx](https://bboxx.com), develop ethical diamond mining technology @[GemFair](https://gemfair.com), and most recently, build the world's leading EV smart charging platform as CTO @[ev.energy](https://ev.energy).
