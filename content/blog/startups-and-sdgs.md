# Startups and SDGs

![UN Sustainable Development Goals](/img/un-sdgs.jpg)

Here is my rundown of the best companies you can work for as an Engineering to do good in the world.

Not all of these are strickley "startups", but let's not let that get in the way of a catching title. Some may be social enterprises, some may be charities, some may have been around for a very long time. But, they are all places where you can use your engineering skills to have a positive impact in the work.
