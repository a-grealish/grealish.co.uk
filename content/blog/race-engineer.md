As the world went digital during the COVID pandemic, the world of motorsport was also forced to go digital. As a motorsport fan, this raised the opportunity to directly compete within the sport I love. Sim Racing and eSports levelled the playing field across all and allowed motorsport amateurs to compete with professionals from the world of motorsport.

However, this raised a question. How do amateurs get the tuition and mentorship they need to develop their skills to be competitive against more experienced drivers? Drivers that has a team of people behind them to optimise their on-track performance, analysing every lap and comparing it against others to advise on where gains can be made. [race.engineer](https://race.engineer/) is the solution to that problem. The digital world produced much more data than the physical. If we can harness the power of this data, we can automate the role of the Race Engineer. We can understand what techniques can make the driver faster and offer targetted advice on where pace can be gained.
