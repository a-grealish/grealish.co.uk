## What influences the impact?

### How much you fly?
The standard UK PPL mandates 45 hours of flight time. Most students will complete their PPL within this number of hours.


### What you fly
Cessnas and Pipers are the backbone of flight schools. Aircraft made by these manufactures are typically small and fairly fuel effeicent.

You can choose a 2-seater aircraft, but some choose to learn in a 4-seater as the 2-seater can be claustrophobic. As a rule, the bigger than plane, the more fuel it will use. 

The engine age may also impact the fuel effeciency.

You can also seek out a flight schoool that uses Pipistrel's Electric Training Aircraft for PPLs. There are not too many of these schools yet, but its growing fast. The carbon emissions of this will typically be much lower than convential powered aircraft.

Simulators can also be used to augment your flight training. This is very low carbon compared to real flight, but sadly the CAA will not count these hours towards your 45 hours required for the PPL.


### What fuel?

AvGas (Aviation Gasoline) is used for smaller aircraft. Keroscene is also used in avaiation, but this is used for larger, jet engined aircraft.

AvGas vaires from the gasoline used in  vehicles in a few ways. Firstly, some AvGas still contains a small amount of Lead. Lead is added to Gasoline in the form of Tetraethyllead. It is used to increase performance, but is a neurotoxin and has been globally phased out in motor vehicles.

The second difference is that Motor Vehicle Gasoline is moving to include a increasing percentage of Ethanol BioFuel, a more sustainable fuel derived from plants rather than fossil fuels. In the UK, many parts of the US and many other countries, the most sold Gasoline ([E10 Fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ethanol_fuel_mixtures#E10_or_less)) is 10% Ethanol, 90% Fossil Fuel.

| Region    |  Name    |  Lead    | Ethanol Percentage  | kg co2e/litre  |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Europe    | 91/96UL  | None     | None                | 2.5<sup>1</sup>|
| US        | 100LL    | 0.56 g/l | None                | 2.5<sup>1</sup>|

## So, how can I calculate my emissions?

Fuel comsumption of different aircraft will vary, but to estimate the emissions we will assume a normal training aircraft, doing normal training sorties will use 15l of AvGas per hour.

Therefore, the total litres used over the full PPL course will be:

`15l of AvGas * 45 hours of training = 675 litres`

To convert this to an amount of Co2e emitted, we again will make some assumption about the density of fuel, i.e. how to convert litres to kg. And, the Co2 emitted for each kg of fuel burned. This value will again vary per engine and how you are flying, but a `3.10` value is a good starting point.

So, with these numbers we find the total emissions to be:

`675 litres * 0.8 (kg/litre) * 3.10 (CO2/Fuel) = 1674 kg co2e`


### How does this compare to other activities

Mike Berner-Lee's "How bad are Bananas" estimates the UK Average total emissions at 15 tonnes co2e (15,000 kg).

So doing a PPL's 45 hours would add 11% to the total yearly emissions for an average UK resisdent.


## How to reduce it?
- Reduce the emissions directly as you fly, look for a school with electric aircraft, use BioFuels, make use of simulators for training
- Immediately remove an equivilent amount of carbon from the air. Direct Air Capture technologies exist, such as [Climeworks](https://climeworks.com/)
- Invest in renewables technologies that will reduce fossil fuel emissions elsewhere. Examples are [Abundance](https://www.abundanceinvestment.com/) or [ripple](https://rippleenergy.com/)
- Offset with tree planting project

1674 * 1.5 (for other logistics emissions) * £0.005<sup>2</sup> = £12.50 to offset a PPL using offset schemes

<sup>2</sup>Based on very basic tree planting service, which has a long carbon reduction period

Or for a more immediate solution, a direct air capture solution can be used. The cost of this is £1,500
